# The Math Maze

CIT 128 Student Directed Project

## Program Description

My program will involve a character that can go into multiple math themed rooms. Each room will have a dedicated challenger in it, and each challenger will have a different subsection of math questions in a given topic. Each challenger will have their own challenge questions, and the goal is to answer each question in each room correctly to win the math championship (defeat all challengers).

My goals are to correctly import graphics and use unique character designs for each character. I need to make sure that the player's character moves correspondingly to the arrow keys on the keyboard. I also need to make sure that I can have a unique set of problems for each challenging character (potentially not repeating) and make the test cases work properly so that the player can move on when the answer is correct and get reverted back when it isn't.

### Video Demonstration

Add a Link to your video demonstration

### Install Instructions

pip install pygame in your code terminal of choice

[potentially installing images with this too?]

Add any install instructions, if needed. This includes how to install included modules or libraries as well as configurations. You may remove this section if no special instructions are required.

## Software Engineering

I am trying to engineer this program with OOP techniques that are clear, with code that will be easy to read (heavily commented). More on this to come

Describe the software engineering techniques used for the design and development of this program.

## Testing Script

Describe the testing process using paragraphs and numbered bullet lists how to manually test the software here.
